        <p><strong>Can we improve the quality of students&rsquo; learning experience without
            increasing staff workload, even for greater student numbers?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The introduction of technology enhanced learning (TEL) methods changes
            the deployment of the most important resource in the education system: 
            teachers&rsquo; and learners&rsquo; time. New technology promises greater 
            personalisation and greater productivity, but without careful 
            modelling of the effects on the use of staff time, TEL methods 
            can easily increase cost without commensurate benefits.

        <p> The Course Resource Appraisal Model is a digital design tool
	    that helps academics developing a module to construct a plan for
	    improved learning benefits, and controlled teaching costs. The
	    intended end users are programme/module leaders who are interested
	    especially in costing the move from traditional to blended or
	    online courses. The tool focuses on the costs linked to staff and
	    student time, and the benefits linked to the types of learning and
	    teaching. One of its principal advantages is that it enables
	    innovators to plan and understand the relationship between the
	    expected learning benefits and the likely teaching costs. Phase 1
	    of the project sets out to develop this tool as a stand-alone
	    online product for use in all IOE departments.

	<p> A prototype version of the tool (known as the CRAM Tool) is now
	    available for user evaluation purposes. To find out more about the CRAM tool,
            take a look at <a href="videos.html" target="_blank">some videos</a> or download it by
	    selecting the version appropriate for your platform below. You <u>require</u> the 
    <a title="Get Java..." href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp" target="_blank">current
        version of Java</a> to be 
    installed on your system. The tool includes a <a href="CRAMUserGuide.pdf">user guide</a>
    and we have provided an
