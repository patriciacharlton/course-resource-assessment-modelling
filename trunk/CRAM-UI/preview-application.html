        <h1>Course Resource Appraisal Model</h1>
        <p>
            As part of the Open Mode work, we have developed a proof-of-concept
            modelling tool to help teaching staff design and plan an optimised 
            model for moving to blended and online courses. The tool helps to 
            ensure that both the efficiency and effectiveness of online 
            teaching are maximised. Phase 1 of the project sets out to develop 
            this tool as a stand-alone online product for use in all IOE 
            departments.
 
        </p>

            A prototype version of the tool (known as the CRAM tool) is now
            available for user evaluation purposes. To launch the CRAM Tool, 
            click on the 'Launch' button below. The
        current version does not include functionality to <em>undo</em> user edits
        or to successfully <em>cancel</em> changes made in dialogue boxes. Download
